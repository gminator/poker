# Porker Test
The purpose of this Project is to demostrate my compencies in Python, OOP, SOLID.

# Brief 

For this program, you will be taking a text input of playing cards and evaluating what the best poker
hand could be constructed with the cards.
For example, given a string input of:
'AS, 10C, 10H, 3D, 3S'

(the cards above are ace of spades, 10 of clubs, 10 of hearts, 3 of diamonds and 3 of spades)
Output would be: 'Two Pair'

# Solution 

This solution will be written using Python3 with no framework, the simple nature of the card classifire does not need the any advance ORM's or Routing mechanism for exposing URLs.

## Design Principles
